# MOVIE GALLERY

My fork.<br><br> This project was implemented as part of a JavaScript team project.<br><br>

My role in the project was the implementation of the Header (HTML, CSS, JS, responsive/adaptive
design). Button scroll up, "viewed," and "queue," working with local storage, genres in the card,
and the modal window, and implementation of teasers view. <br><br>
